"Specific pollutants can induce airway inflammation (eg, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and PM <2·5 μm in diameter [PM2·5])23–28 and airway hyper-responsiveness (ozone and nitrogen dioxide),23,29 two characteristic features of asthma. In addition, oxidative stress (a feature of severe asthma) has been associated with pollutant exposures (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and PM2·5).30–32 Therefore, exposure to these pollutants is unsurprisingly associated with exacerbations and possibly even the onset of asthma. The mechanisms by which pollutants induce these effects are not completely clear."

"Presently, short-term exposures to ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, PM2·5, and TRAP is thought to increase the risk of exacerbations of asthma symptoms. Increasing amounts of evidence also suggest that long-term exposures to air pollution, especially TRAP and its surrogate, nitrogen dioxide, can contribute to new-onset asthma in both children and adults."
